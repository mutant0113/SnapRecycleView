# SnapRecycleView
This project shows how to snap the center of the target child view to the "left" of the attached RecyclerView

Use AlignLeftLinearSnapHelper which extends from LinearSnapHelper to get child view aligning left instead of aligning center

LinearSnapHelper可用來對齊RecycleView的item到中間，這邊複寫方法為對齊左邊
